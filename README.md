# Fortech-Assessment-AQA-Pre-Employment

The exercise I have decided to present is from HackerRank, a website I usually use to enhance my problem solving skills. I chose to solve it in JavaScript. 

An avid hiker keeps meticulous records of their hikes. During the last hike that took exactly <b>steps</b> steps, for every step it was noted if it was an uphill, <b>U</b>, or a downhill, <b>D</b> step. Hikes always start and end at sea level, and each step up or down represents a <b>1</b> unit change in altitude. We define the following terms:
<ul>
  <li>A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level.</li>
  <li>A valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level.</li>
</ul>
Given the sequence of up and down steps during a hike, find and print the number of valleys walked through.
